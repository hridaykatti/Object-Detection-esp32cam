# Object-Detection-esp32cam
Object Detection using ESP32-CAM and Edge Impulse is a TinyML project where an ESP32-CAM module performs real-time object detection using a deep learning model trained in Edge Impulse Studio. The model is deployed directly on the ESP32, enabling low-power, on-device computer vision without reliance on cloud services.
